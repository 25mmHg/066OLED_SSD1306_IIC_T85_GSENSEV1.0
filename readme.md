# cheap 2digit OLED counter for tools in a sheltered workshop
### Motivation
There are many tasks in a workshop requiring the counting of parts. Ideally this would be accomplished during manufacturing.
In our factory we cut small teflon tubes using a drill stand-like tool with a mounted blade and put 50 of them after cutting in a small zip lock bag. There is no way of counting the tubes by weight because they are too small. I thought about counting the movements of the tool lever. An easy way of accomplishing this is using a g-force sensor to measure the angle of the lever relative to earth's gravity. This eliminates the need for additional mechanical parts or end switches. Sticking the g-force sensor on the lever is sufficient.
### Implementation
Because the g-force sensor MMA7361 is an analog device, I can process the output values of the X-axis sensor with an analog lowpass filter. After passing the 10 bit ADC of the ATtiny 85 I use a digital FIR highpass filter with 31 taps for further signal processing. The result is a hybrid bandpass filter with a sharp PASS band of about 0.5 to 8Hz. That's sufficient for our requirements and rejects most of the analog noise and vibrations (lowpass filter) and position issues (highpass filter). 
If the sensor is moving 20Â° and back within 4 seconds and the filter values pass a higher and a lower threshold in a given time window the counter increments by one. The counter value is displayed on an OLED-display.
